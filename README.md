# Gallery-GPT

This repository contains the code, data and model for the paper titled "GalleryGPT: Analyzing Paintings with Large Multimodal Models".

## Latest News ðŸ”¥
* [2024-7-18] We released [code](https://github.com/steven640pixel/Gallery-GPT), [PaintingForm dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/steven16/Painting-Form/tree/main) and [GalleryGPT LoRA checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qLbnxxBwZ15ejaHES_LRCi2Fahv3Od5G?usp=drive_link)

## Install Packages
```
cd Gallery-GPT
conda create -n gallery_gpt python=3.10 -y
conda activate gallery_gpt
pip install -e .
pip install protobuf
```
## Enable Deepspeed and Flash-attention
```
pip install -e ".[train]"
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

## Data Preparation
Download [PaintingForm dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/steven16/Painting-Form/tree/main).

The overall pipeline of constructing our PaintingForm:
![ex1](data_pipeline.png)


"train_samples_tuning.json" corresponds to the annotations of painting formal analysis for instruction finetuning. 

Place the data in the root or other directory.
Data structure:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ art_images_data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/0.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/1.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ train_samples_tuning.json
```

## Run LoRA-finetuning
```
sh finetune_lora_task.sh
```

## Checkpoints and Inference
You can download [base model](https://huggingface.co/Lin-Chen/ShareGPT4V-7B) then replace config.json with ours in root directory, and [LoRA checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qLbnxxBwZ15ejaHES_LRCi2Fahv3Od5G?usp=drive_link).
For inference:
```
python 
```
